# How to Use RustPlus-Chat-Bot

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the RustPlus-Chat-Bot.

### Step 0: Install Extension in Browser

If you didn't have an extension [install it](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rustpluspy-link-companion/gojhnmnggbnflhdcpcemeahejhcimnlf?pli=1) (its not mine)
Then you need to start it, log to Steam account and Ingame make a request connection to Rust+ mobile app.
And after that the Extension will find your request and you'll have enough data to use bot

### Step 1: Start the Bot

Start RustPlusBot.exe file and do NOT delete '_internal' directory!!!




If you entered server information and saw an error for a second, itâ€™s okay, try restarting the bot and everything will work out.
