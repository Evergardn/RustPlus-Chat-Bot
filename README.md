# Tutorial how to use (free-version)

# Step 1: Download and extract files
  1. Download the archive with the program to your computer.
  2. Unzip the archive to your desktop. This can be done using built-in Windows tools or third-party archivers such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
  3. Make sure that the folder with the program is on the desktop and is called, for example, `RustPlus-Chat-Bot`.

# Step 2: Opening a Command Prompt
  1. Press the key combination `Win + R` to open the Run window.
  2. Type `cmd` and press `Enter` to open the command line **or**:
   - Right-click on the Start menu and select **Windows PowerShell** (or **Command Prompt**).
   
# Step 3: Move to the program directory
  1. In the command line that opens, enter the following command to go to the program folder:
     ```bash
     cd Desktop/RustPlus-Chat-Bot
     ```
     This command will take you to the folder on your desktop where the program files are located.

# Step 4: Creating a virtual environment Python
  1. At the command prompt, run the following command to create the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     py -m venv venv
     ```
     This will create an isolated virtual Python environment so that all of the program's dependencies are installed locally and do not conflict with other projects.
     
# Step 5: Activate venv (virtual enviroment)
  1. Activate the virtual environment (if you are using Windows):
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
     If you are using PowerShell, first run the following command to enable script execution:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
     Then activate the virtual environment again:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

  2. Download obligatory libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install rustplus python-dotenv
      ```

# Step 6: Run the program
  1. Go to the `manage` directory where the launch file is located:
     ```bash
     cd manage
     ```
  2. Run the command to start the program:
     ```bash
     py main.py
     ```

 Completion
After completing these steps, the program should start working. If everything went well, you will see corresponding messages on the command line. 

 Advi—Åe:
- If something doesn't work, make sure you have activated the virtual environment and entered the commands correctly.
- If errors occur, check that the files are unpacked correctly and the dependencies are installed.
- Check that u download python on the page: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
